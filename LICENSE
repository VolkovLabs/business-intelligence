## License

### Scope of License

We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the Application, strictly per this Agreement’s terms.

## Third-Party Services

The Application may include or link to third-party content or services. We are not responsible for their accuracy, legality, or quality, and bear no liability for them.

You use Third-Party Services at your own risk, subject to their terms, which you must comply with.

## Term and Termination

This Agreement remains effective until terminated by you or us. We may suspend or terminate it at our discretion, with or without notice.

It terminates automatically if you breach any term. You may terminate by deleting the Application and all copies from your Device. Upon termination, you must cease use and remove all copies.

Termination does not limit our legal rights or remedies for your breaches during the term.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold Volkov Labs LLC, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and licensors harmless from claims, including legal fees, arising from: (a) your use of the Application; (b) your violation of this Agreement or laws; or (c) your infringement of third-party rights.

## No Warranties

The Application is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," with all faults and no warranties. We disclaim all implied or statutory warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for purpose) to the fullest extent allowed by law.

We do not guarantee the Application will meet your needs, operate uninterrupted, or be error-free, nor that it’s free of harmful components. Where disclaimers can’t apply, we’re solely responsible for any mandatory warranties.

## Limitation of Liability

Our liability, and that of our suppliers, is limited to the amount you paid for the Application regardless of damages incurred.

To the fullest extent allowed by law, we are not liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., loss of profits, data, or privacy) related to the Application, even if advised of such possibilities.

Some jurisdictions may not allow these limitations, so they apply to the maximum extent permitted.

## Severability and Waiver

### Severability

If any provision is unenforceable, it will be adjusted to meet its intent as legally possible, with remaining provisions unaffected.

Failing to enforce a right or obligation does not waive it for the future, nor does waiving a breach waive subsequent breaches.

We make no warranties about the Application beyond what’s stated here.

## United States Legal Compliance

You confirm you are not in a U.S.-embargoed country or on any U.S. prohibited/restricted parties list.
